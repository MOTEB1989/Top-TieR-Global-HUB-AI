# Service Verification Report

## Docker Compose
- Attempted to run `docker compose up --build`, but the command failed because Docker is not installed in the execution environment.
- As a result, none of the services (Gateway, DB Hub, Dashboard, KB API) could be started.

## Secrets Validation
- Environment variables `LEXCODE_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `LEXCODE_OPENAI_KEY` are not set in the current environment.
- Without these secrets, certain authenticated operations and OpenAI integrations cannot be exercised.

## API Tests
- Database Query, RAG Query, KB Search, and KB Ask LLM endpoints could not be tested because the services were not running.

## Dashboard
- The web dashboard at `http://localhost:3001` could not be accessed because the dashboard service was not started.

## Codex Integration
- GitHub Actions and Codex integrations were not verifiable from this environment.

## Summary
- Blocked by missing Docker installation and absent required secrets.
- No automated or manual service tests could be executed.
