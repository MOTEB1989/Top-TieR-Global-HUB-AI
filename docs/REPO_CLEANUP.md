# Repository Cleanup Summary

The following legacy artifacts were removed to declutter the project root and avoid confusing duplicates:

- **TopTireAI** – legacy copy/paste instructions for a different FastAPI scaffold.
- **bluetooth-open-diagnostics.zip** and **bluetooth-open-diagnostics2.zip** – archived projects unrelated to the OSINT stack.
- **top-tier-base-files.zip** and **topTireAI-quality-pack.zip** – redundant bundles duplicating documentation already tracked in Git.
- **veritas-nexus-v2.zip** – archived README copy that duplicated existing project docs.
- **veritas_workflows_addon** – placeholder shell snippet for a detached workflow add-on.

By removing these unused assets, the repository focuses on the actively maintained FastAPI service, scripts, and infrastructure code.
