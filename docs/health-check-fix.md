# Veritas Health Check Solution

## Problem Summary
The Veritas health check was failing with status `000000` for both CORE_API (port 8000) and VERITAS_WEB (port 8080) because the services were not running during the CI workflow execution.

## Root Cause
1. **Import Issue**: The API server in `api_server/__init__.py` couldn't import the `gpt_client` module due to incorrect Python path
2. **Missing Service Startup**: The GitHub Actions workflow was running health checks without starting the actual services first
3. **Port Configuration**: The health check expected services on specific ports but they weren't configured to run automatically

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Issue
- Updated `api_server/__init__.py` to correctly import `gpt_client` module by adding the parent directory to Python path
- **Before**: `from gpt_client import GPTClient, GPTRequest, GPTResponse` (failed)
- **After**: Added `sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))` before import

### 2. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow
Modified `.github/workflows/veritas-health.yml` to:
- Install Python dependencies for both main API and veritas-web service
- Start both services in background before running health checks
- Wait for services to be ready using curl with retry logic
- Clean up background processes after health check completion

### 3. Created Service Startup Script
Added `scripts/start_services.sh` for local testing and development:
- Automatically installs dependencies
- Starts API server on port 8000
- Starts Veritas-web service on port 8080
- Waits for services to be ready
- Provides cleanup on script termination

## Services Verification

### CORE_API (localhost:8000)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /health`
- **Response**: `{"status":"ok","version":"2.0.0"}`
- **Status**: ✅ Working

### VERITAS_WEB (localhost:8080)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /health`
- **Response**: Comprehensive health status including dependencies
- **Status**: ✅ Working

### Health Check Results
```bash
== Veritas Stack Health Check ==
Wed Sep 17 05:04:45 UTC 2025
Checking CORE_API at http://localhost:8000/health ...
✅ CORE_API is healthy (200)
Checking VERITAS_WEB at http://localhost:8080/health ...
✅ VERITAS_WEB is healthy (200)
== Health check complete ==
✅ All services are healthy
```

## Files Modified
1. `api_server/__init__.py` - Fixed import path for gpt_client module
2. `.github/workflows/veritas-health.yml` - Added service startup and dependency installation
3. `scripts/start_services.sh` - New startup script for development (created)

## Usage

### For Local Development
```bash
# Start services manually
./scripts/start_services.sh

# Run health check
./scripts/veritas_health_check.sh

# Stop services
./scripts/start_services.sh stop
```

### For CI/CD
The GitHub Actions workflow now automatically:
1. Installs dependencies
2. Starts services in background
3. Runs health checks
4. Cleans up services

## Impact
- ✅ Health check now passes consistently
- ✅ Services start correctly in CI environment
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Added development tooling for easier local testing
