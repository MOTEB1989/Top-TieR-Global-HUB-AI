# Top-TieR-Global-HUB-AI

This repository has been reorganized for clarity. Key documentation now lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md), and services, databases, scripts, tests, and release assets are grouped in dedicated folders. See the restructure report in [`docs/REPO_RESTRUCTURE_REPORT.md`](docs/REPO_RESTRUCTURE_REPORT.md) for details about the moves.
