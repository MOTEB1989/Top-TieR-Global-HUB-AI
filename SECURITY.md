## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

### Preferred: Private Security Advisory
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/MOTEB1989/Top-TieR-Global-HUB-AI/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form

### Alternative: Email
Send an email to: **security@moteb.dev** (if this email is not available, contact @MOTEB1989 directly)

Please include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
3. **Investigation**: We will investigate and work on a fix
4. **Resolution**: We will coordinate the release of fixes and public disclosure

## Security Considerations for OSINT Platform

This project is an educational OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) platform. Please be aware of the following security considerations:

### Data Handling
- **Personal Data**: Be cautious when collecting and storing personal information
- **Data Retention**: Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Data Anonymization**: Consider anonymizing sensitive data where possible

### API Security
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Input validation is performed on all endpoints

### Infrastructure Security
- Docker containers run with non-root users
- Secrets should never be committed to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot

### OSINT-Specific Security
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- **Terms of Service**: Respect data source terms of service and rate limits
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Follow responsible disclosure practices
- **Privacy Protection**: Implement appropriate privacy safeguards

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed before merging
2. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up to date
3. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets or API keys
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
6. **Logging**: Log security-relevant events without exposing sensitive data

## Compliance and Regulations

This project aims to comply with:
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- **SOC 2** security standards (where applicable)
- **OWASP** security guidelines

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **Project Maintainer**: @MOTEB1989
