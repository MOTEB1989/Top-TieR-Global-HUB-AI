## 🔍 PR Analysis & Merge Conflict Resolution

Thank you for the Flask dependency update, @dependabot!

### Current Status
This PR attempts to update Flask from 2.0.3 to 2.2.5, but there appears to be a merge conflict with the current requirements.txt file.

### Issue Identified
- **PR changes**: Updates Flask 2.0.3 → 2.2.5 and related dependencies
- **Main branch**: Currently uses FastAPI-based dependencies
- **Conflict**: The main branch has evolved to use FastAPI instead of Flask

### Recommended Actions
1. **For maintainers**:
   - This PR may be outdated since the project has migrated from Flask to FastAPI
   - Consider closing this PR if Flask is no longer used
   - Review if any Flask dependencies are still needed alongside FastAPI

2. **Alternative approach**:
   - If Flask is still needed for specific components, manually merge the required Flask dependencies
   - Update the requirements.txt to include both Flask and FastAPI dependencies if both are needed

### Dependencies Comparison
**PR #6 suggests:**
```
Flask==2.2.5
Werkzeug>=2.2.3
Jinja2>=3.1.2
click>=8.0
itsdangerous>=2.1.2
requests==2.32.4
```

**Current main branch:**
```
fastapi>=0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0
pydantic>=2.5.0
python-multipart>=0.0.6
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

Would you like me to help resolve this by either:
- Closing this PR if Flask is no longer needed
- Creating a new PR that properly merges Flask dependencies with the current FastAPI setup
